    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to my first webpage, a digital moque-up of my resume with a theme
      circa 1990. I sincerley hope that future iterations of this will show my
      growth and learning in the use of front-end and back-end web technologies.
      However, I would say <em>bonus points</em> are in order for the
      retro-style!
